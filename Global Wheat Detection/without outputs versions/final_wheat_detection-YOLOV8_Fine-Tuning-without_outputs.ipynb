    "# 🌾 KerasCV YOLOv8 for Global Wheat Head Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the training methodology for the **Global Wheat Detection Kaggle Competition**, addressing the critical task of accurate **object localization of wheat heads** within diverse agricultural imagery. The challenge requires robust generalization across significant variations in lighting, wheat variety, growth stage, and camera perspective.\n",

    "## I. Methodology and Architecture\n",
    "The core of this solution utilizes the **YOLOv8 object detection architecture**, implemented via the accelerated and standardized API provided by the **KerasCV library**. This choice facilitates rapid iteration while maintaining access to state-of-the-art model structures and leveraging optimized TensorFlow backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Training Strategy: Stratified Optimization\n",
    "To ensure optimal convergence and performance, a **three-phase, stratified training regime** is employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Warmup Phase:** A short initial training period with a controlled learning rate increase to stabilize model weights and prevent early-stage divergence.\n",
    "2.  **Mid-Tune Phase:** The primary training period, utilizing an optimized learning rate schedule (e.g., cosine decay) for comprehensive feature learning.\n",
    "3.  **Fine-Tune Phase:** A final, low-learning-rate stage dedicated to subtle refinement of weights, maximizing the model's predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## III. Evaluation Framework\n",
    "Performance is measured using the standard competition metric: the **mean Average Precision (mAP)**. For accurate and compliant calculation of these metrics, we leverage the **cocometrics** library. This package provides a highly robust and widely adopted implementation of the COCO (Common Objects in Context) evaluation protocol, ensuring reliable and standard analysis of object detection performance across various Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds.\n",

    "## IV. Workflow and Artifact Management\n",
    "This notebook is strictly dedicated to the **training process**. To maintain a clean, efficient workflow and simplify the final submission environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Checkpointing:** Successful model weights are saved at various stages throughout the training process.\n",
    "* **Artifact Export:** The final, trained model is systematically **exported and saved** to disk. This saved artifact will be loaded into a **separate, dedicated inference notebook** responsible solely for prediction generation, test-time augmentation (TTA) application, and submission file creation.\n",

    "1.  A **new, dedicated inference notebook** will be created, separate from the primary training script.\n",
