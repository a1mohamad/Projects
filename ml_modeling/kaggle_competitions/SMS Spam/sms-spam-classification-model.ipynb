    "# 🤖 SMS Spam Classification — Deep Learning & Bayesian Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook constitutes the second phase of our project: **Advanced Modeling and Hyperparameter Optimization**. Having completed a thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in the previous stage, we now leverage those insights to construct a sophisticated deep learning architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to move beyond heuristic-based classification and implement a **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)** network. This model is engineered to interpret the complex, sequential relationships within SMS text, allowing for a more nuanced distinction between legitimate communication (Ham) and unsolicited outreach (Spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Bridging the Gap: Insights from EDA\n",
    "The architectural choices in this notebook are not arbitrary; they are the direct result of our findings in the EDA phase:\n",
    "* **The Imbalance Challenge**: We confirmed that **86.6%** of our data is \"Ham.\" To ensure the model doesn't simply default to the majority class, we implement stratified data handling and loss-function penalization.\n",
    "* **Linguistic Variance**: EDA showed that spam utilizes specific \"urgency\" patterns and non-standard syntax. To capture this, we use an **Embedding Layer** to map words into a multi-dimensional semantic space.\n",
    "* **Structural Signatures**: Since spam messages are statistically longer, we employ **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** to maintain a \"memory\" of long-range dependencies across the entire sequence of the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Technical Workflow & Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To deliver a production-grade classifier, we implement the following technical pillars:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Adaptive Text Vectorization\n",
    "Rather than using static word counts, we implement a dynamic `TextVectorization` layer. This layer acts as an automated preprocessor that:\n",
    "* **Standardizes** raw text by removing punctuation and lowercasing.\n",
    "* **Tokenizes** strings into individual word units.\n",
    "* **Indexes** the tokens into a vocabulary based on frequency, ensuring the model focuses on the most informative words identified during EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Label Engineering & Categorical Encoding\n",
    "Neural networks require purely numerical inputs for the loss function to calculate gradients. We utilize **Label Encoding** with `tf.keras.layers.StringLookup` to map our categorical targets (`ham`, `spam`) into a binary vector space ($0$ and $1$). This transformation is critical as it allows our final output neuron—equipped with a **Sigmoid** activation—to produce a probability score between $0.0$ and $1.0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Sequence Modeling with Bidirectional LSTMs\n",
    "Short messages often hide their intent in the relationship between words. A standard LSTM reads text from left to right, but a **Bidirectional LSTM** processes the sequence in both directions simultaneously. This provides the model with a \"global\" context of the SMS, allowing it to understand that a word at the end of a sentence might fundamentally change the meaning of a word at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Bayesian Hyperparameter Tuning (Optuna)\n",
    "Finding the right number of neurons, embedding dimensions, and dropout rates is traditionally a manual \"guess-and-check\" process. We utilize **Optuna**, a state-of-the-art optimization framework, to perform **Bayesian Optimization**. By using the **Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)**, Optuna learns from each trial to narrow down the search space and find the mathematical global optimum for our validation accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. High-Performance Input Pipelines (tf.data)\n",
    "To ensure computational efficiency, especially when using GPU acceleration, we utilize the `tf.data` API. This allows us to implement **Prefetching** and **Caching**, which decouples data augmentation and loading from the model execution, ensuring the \"training engine\" never waits for the \"data delivery.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚖️ A Strategic Note on Optuna Pruning\n",
    "In this notebook, you will see the inclusion of the `TFKerasPruningCallback`. **Pruning** is a mechanism that tracks the performance of an optimization trial in real-time. If a trial's performance trajectory suggests it will not surpass the current best model, Optuna terminates the trial early to save time and energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision: We have opted NOT to activate the pruning logic during this study.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Rationale**: The SMS Spam dataset is compact, and our Bi-LSTM architecture is highly optimized for speed. On current hardware, a single trial completes in seconds.\n",
    "* **The Advantage**: By allowing every trial to finish, we gather a more complete \"map\" of the hyperparameter landscape without the risk of early termination for a model that might have converged later in training.\n",
    "* **The Purpose**: We have kept the pruning infrastructure in the code as a **professional template**. It serves to demonstrate how this workflow would be scaled for massive datasets (like the IMDB 50k or Twitter sentiment corpora) where training takes hours and pruning becomes a financial and temporal necessity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Implementation Roadmap\n",
    "The notebook is structured into logical sections for clarity and reproducibility:\n",
    "1. **Environment & Reproducibility**: Setting global seeds and initializing hardware strategy.\n",
    "2. **Data Transformation**: Label encoding and stratified splitting.\n",
    "3. **Pipeline Engineering**: Constructing the `tf.data` and `Vectorization` layers.\n",
    "4. **The Optimization Study**: Executing the Optuna Bayesian search.\n",
    "5. **Final Model Synthesis**: Training the \"Winner\" and performing a deep-dive into Precision, Recall, and the Confusion Matrix."

    "* **Embedding Layer**: This acts as a dynamic lookup table that maps discrete integer indices into a continuous vector space. It learns the semantic proximity of tokens, effectively grouping words like \"win,\" \"prize,\" and \"claim\" into a similar mathematical \"meaning-space.\"\n",
    "* **Bidirectional LSTM Core**: Standard LSTMs process text unidirectionally (left-to-right). Our **Bidirectional** wrapper duplicates the LSTM layer—one processes the SMS from start to finish, and the other from finish to start. This dual-lens approach is critical for spam detection, as it captures context that might be split across the message, such as a \"Greeting\" at the beginning and a \"Malicious Link\" at the end.\n",
    "* **Dynamic Dense Bottleneck**: Following the LSTM, we implement a modular series of **Dense** layers with **ReLU** activations. These layers perform high-level feature extraction, condensing the sequential patterns identified by the LSTM into a final classification signal.\n",
    "* **Regularization (Dropout)**: To prevent the model from memorizing specific training samples (overfitting), we apply Dropout. This randomly deactivates a percentage of neurons during each training step, forcing the network to learn more robust and generalized features."

    "### 7.2 The Optuna Optimization Paradigm: Beyond Random Search\n",
    "Hyperparameter optimization is the process of finding the configuration that maximizes our objective function (Validation Accuracy). In deep learning, this is a \"Black-Box\" problem because we cannot calculate a direct gradient for parameters like \"number of layers\" or \"learning rate.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Bayesian Optimization & TPE\n",
    "Optuna utilizes the **Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)**. Unlike Grid Search, which is slow and exhaustive, or Random Search, which ignores previous history, TPE is **Bayesian**. \n",
    "* **The \"History\" Effect**: TPE builds a probability model (a surrogate model) of the objective function based on the results of past trials. \n",
    "* **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: It uses this model to decide where to \"sample\" next, intelligently balancing the search between unknown regions and regions that have historically yielded high scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Defining the Search Space (Suggest API)\n",
    "Optuna allows us to define a dynamic, conditional search space. This makes the architecture itself flexible:\n",
    "* **Categorical Suggestions**: Used for fixed choices, such as selecting an embedding dimension (16, 32, or 64).\n",
    "* **Float Suggestions (Log-Uniform)**: Crucial for the `learning_rate` and `weight_decay`. Because these values operate across different orders of magnitude ($10^{-5}$ vs $10^{-3}$), searching on a logarithmic scale ensures the optimizer samples small values just as effectively as large ones.\n",
    "* **Integer Suggestions (Step-based)**: Used for the number of Dense layers or units, allowing the search to move in discrete, logical increments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. The Lifecycle of an Optuna Trial\n",
    "Each trial follows a standardized, automated workflow:\n",
    "1. **Suggestion**: Optuna’s TPE sampler provides a unique hyperparameter set.\n",
    "2. **Construction**: The `create_model` function builds a fresh Bi-LSTM graph based on those suggestions.\n",
    "3. **Execution**: The model is compiled within the distributed `strategy.scope()` and trained.\n",
    "4. **Observation**: The validation accuracy is reported back to the `study` object to inform future trials."

    "### 8.3 Defensive Training via Callbacks\n",
    "To ensure the model reaches its peak performance without drifting into overfitting, we implement a suite of strategic callbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **EarlyStopping**: We monitor the `val_loss` with a patience of 10 epochs. If the model stops improving on the validation set, the training is halted immediately, and `restore_best_weights=True` ensures we keep the model at its highest performing state.\n",
    "2.  **ModelCheckpoint**: This automatically serializes and saves the best iteration of our model to `SMS_Spam_best_model.keras`. This guarantees that even if a system failure occurs, we have preserved the most accurate version of our classifier.\n",
    "3.  **ReduceLROnPlateau**: When the model's progress on validation loss plateaus, this callback dynamically reduces the learning rate by a factor of 0.3. This allows the optimizer to \"fine-tune\" the weights in the local minima, achieving higher precision.\n",
    "4.  **TensorBoard**: We enable deep telemetry by logging histograms and training curves to `/kaggle/working/logs`. This allows for a post-training visual audit of weight distributions and gradient stability."

    "## 9. Final Conclusion & Performance Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully transitioned from raw text exploration to a high-performance **Bi-LSTM** classification engine. By leveraging **Bayesian Optimization** via Optuna and a hardware-aware **tf.data** pipeline, we have engineered a solution that is both mathematically optimized and computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.1 Empirical Training Analysis\n",
    "Our final training logs reveal a highly successful convergence. The model demonstrated rapid learning, as evidenced by the performance trajectory:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rapid Convergence**: By Epoch 5, the model achieved a **Validation AUC of 0.9880**, indicating an exceptional ability to distinguish between the two classes with very few false positives.\n",
    "* **Peak Generalization**: The \"Champion\" model reached its optimal state at **Epoch 11**, achieving:\n",
    "    * **Validation Accuracy**: ~98.8%\n",
    "    * **Validation Precision**: 97.3%\n",
    "    * **Validation Recall**: 93.5%\n",
    "* **Stability through Regularization**: The use of **ReduceLROnPlateau** was instrumental. As the loss plateaued around Epoch 15, the learning rate was systematically decayed (from $3.23 \\times 10^{-4}$ to $8.72 \\times 10^{-6}$), allowing the model to settle into a stable local minimum without oscillating.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.2 Key Technical Takeaways\n",
    "The success of this architecture can be attributed to three primary strategic decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Optimized Semantic Depth**: Optuna identified that a relatively lean architecture (16 embedding dimensions and 16 LSTM units) provided the best generalization. This prevents the \"memorization\" of noise—a common pitfall in small text datasets.\n",
    "2.  **Imbalance Mitigation**: The integration of **Class Weights** allowed the model to maintain a high **Recall (~93.5%)** despite the heavy skew toward \"Ham\" messages. The model \"learned\" that missing a spam message was significantly more costly than misclassifying a legitimate one.\n",
    "3.  **Sequential Intelligence**: The **Bidirectional LSTM** proved highly effective at capturing the \"urgency\" and \"reward\" patterns typical of modern spam, processing context from both directions to ensure no deceptive signals were missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.3 Production Readiness\n",
    "The final model has been serialized as `SMS_Spam_best_model.keras`. With a **Validation AUC of 0.98+**, this system is ready for deployment in real-time filtering environments. The inclusion of the `TextVectorization` and `StringLookup` layers within the preprocessing pipeline ensures that the model can be served as a \"black box\"—accepting raw string inputs and returning highly accurate spam probability scores with minimal latency.\n",
